Dear Sir,

I, Guddu Kumar are writing to express my interest in the recent campus  drive Software Graduate Trainee role. I believe I could bring valuable skills and experience to Ontum Education that would make me an ideal fit for this position.

I am a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at CMR Institute of Technology, with a 7.2 CGPA so far. I spend most of my free time developing my coding skills, and new technologies.

Always striving to improve, I have created several side projects in android , DBMS, and java, which you can find on my resume for detail. The one I am most proud of is the VTU Updates, which is an android app based on Firebase and uploaded in the google play store.

Working at Ontum Education would be the perfect environment for me to grow and develop, and not only something to put on my resume. I have attached a resume along with the application. I am confident that I will live up to the expectations of the company.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Guddu Kumar
